# Web Monitoring
used [datadog] (https://www.datadoghq.com/) to monitor different 
kinds of services made possible by the server

In this project I registered myself on [datadog] (https://www.datadoghq.com/)
Set up a dashboard for my server by installing an agent on the server and changing the hostname.
Set up a monitor that checks the number of read requests issued to the device per second.
Set up a monitor that checks the number of write requests issued to the device per second.
